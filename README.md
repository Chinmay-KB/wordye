# WordYe
A little discord game, inspired by Impractical Jokers!

## Inspiration ✨✨
This project was made at Impractical Hackathon, a name eerily similar to "Impractical Jokers", a show which I absolutely love. In this project, I have tried to implement a little challenge that's played in the TV show, in the form of a discord bot

## What it does 🤔
### What happens on the slow
The jokers challenge each other to make a random stranger say a word that is chosen by the other jokers. An example of such a challenge can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7mMp5PXKIk)

### What the bot does
* Any user on the server can start a new game by typing `&start`. 🏇
* The bot will DM a random user in the server with a random word. ⁉
* The goal of that user is to make other people guess which word they have been given, without actually explicitly mentioing the word itself.😮
* From the moment `&start` was typed, the user has to make others guess before 20 messages are exchanged on the server. 🤐
* If the person themselves use the word, they will be caught by the bot. 👊👊

## How we built it
* This project has been over 6 years in the making! That's how long I've been watching the show! 📺
* The bot is built using Discord.js 🤖
* Deployed on GCP ⛈

## Challenges we ran into
* I'm not the most confident with Node.js, and it was my first time working with Discord.js. 🙅‍♂️
* Working with server intents on Discord. 😫
* Fetching the complete list of users on a server is unusually tough, and there exists no full fledged stack overflow answer. Will write one. 😎

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* A small tribute to my favourite TV show. 🙇‍♂️
* Learning how to make discord bots over a span of hours! 🥇

## What's next for Word'ye
* More challenges 💪
* Leaderboards 💯
* A grand punishment for the loser 😭😭
